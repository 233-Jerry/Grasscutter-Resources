> <em>Resource Version - "Certain Anime Game" 3.0.0</em><br/>

> NOTICE: Source use 2.8 version, so there might be issues with 3.x content (Not Full Data).

- ExcelBinOutput - [ V2.8 QuestExcelConfigData ]
- BinOutput
- Scripts 
- Readable
- Subtitle
- TextMap
- CutsceneKeys

## Known Issue
* In future I might delete some Quest that don't work and create my own new Quest since there are no new Quest since 3.0.
* Because DockerGS use JNLua instead JNA, so we reject (script_fixes) so if you are using original Grasscutter please use original repo from Koko (but in future when we manage to fix "stuck white screen" we will accept it again)
